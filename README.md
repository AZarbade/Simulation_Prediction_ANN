## About This Project
- 👓 Supervised and developed under **Armament Research & Development Establishment, Pashan, Pune 411021, India**
- 🔭 Checking to see if using Neural Networks are capable of aiding in Analysis and Simulation fields
- 🔮 Predicting prenetration index of ballistics on different materials, but using only limited simulation data
- 🌱 If sucessful this project can greatly reduce the time taken in any major development process
- 🏗️ Made with 💖 using <img height="16" width="16" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/pytorch" style="vertical-align: bottom;"/>
