## About This Project
- 👓 Supervised and developed under **Armament Research & Development Establishment, Pashan, Pune 411021, India**
- 🔭 Checking to see if using Neural Networks are capable of aiding in Analysis and Simulation fields
- 🔮 Predicting prenetration index of ballistics on different materials, but using only limited simulation data
- 🌱 If sucessful this project can greatly reduce the time taken in any major development process
- 🏗️ Made with 💖 using <img height="16" width="16" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/pytorch" style="vertical-align: bottom;"/>

## 🛠 Current Implimentation

- **[Multi Layer Perceptron - MLP](LINK)** - A simple MLP neural network is being used to predict the results. Hyper-parmeters were tunned to minimize the validation loss. K-Fold method is used to circulate data points and average out scores over 15 runs.
- **[Baseline](https://wandb.ai/wrongcolor/HVIS_Baseline?workspace=user-wrongcolor)** - Baseline view and logs for neural network model. Here, Loss: mean_squared_error and root_mean_squared_error.
- **[Pre-Processing Check](https://wandb.ai/wrongcolor/HVIS_PreProcessingCheck?workspace=user-wrongcolor)** - Detailed view and logs for checking **impact of pre-processing on loss**. Here, Loss: mean_squared_error and root_mean_squared_error.
